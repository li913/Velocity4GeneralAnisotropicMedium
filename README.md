# Velocity4GeneralAnisotropicMedium
This code is used to calculate the group velocity and its derivatives with respect to 21 elastic moduli for a general anisotropic medium
1. floating point variables are double-precision.
2. lapack or mkl is needed by subroutine phaseAndRayVelocity_mkl, but this sub is not necessary.
3. and you should compile the codes with option -DDOUBLE.
